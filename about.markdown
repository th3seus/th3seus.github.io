My name is Stephen and I am currently a security consultant at [NCC Group][ncc-group]. My current
interests with regards to infosec are:

* Network penetration testing
* Red Teaming and Computer Network Operations
* Industrial Control Systems

I have an A.S in Cybersecurity from [Merritt College][merritt] in Oakland, CA. Outside of hacking and security, I love to cook good food and break limbs in Brazilian jiu jitsu.

I started this blog because writing things out is a great way to build and retain knowledge, and
because it's a simple way to give back. If someone is able to solve a problem because of this, then
I can die happy.
